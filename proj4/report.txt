Group Members: Makenzie Johnson and Nicholas Wadinata

Makenzie: Created a file that generated random maps and created text files to hold different map sizes. Also worked
on the benchmark and answered the questions.

Nicholas: Worked on dijkstras.cpp, the benchmark, and answer the questions.


Questions:

1. How did you represent the map as a graph?

2. What is complexity of your implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm?

3. How well does your implementation scale?

All of the maps ran extremely fast; all less than 1 second. But for memory usage, it wasn't too bad for the first few maps. 
However, we managed to allocate 76 millon bytes (76 MB) which is a lot for a simple file.
